# used-car-price-analysis
In this project, I analyzed used car data to understand price behavior, demand patterns, and inventory distribution. The dashboard highlights factors such as brand, fuel type, transmission, and location that influence car prices. I also analyzed average days on market and inventory concentration to understand demand strength.
